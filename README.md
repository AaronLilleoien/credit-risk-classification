## Overview of the Analysis

This analysis was to build a model to predict healthy vs. high-risk loans. Data used in the model included loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income percent, number of accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt. 
A database of 77,536 records were used for the model with 75% allocated to train the Logistic Regression Model model and 25% used for testing.  


## Results

Machine Learning Model Results:
  *Healthy Loan precision 1.00
  *Healthy Loan recall 0.99
  *High-risk loan precision 0.86
  *High-risk loan recall 0.91
  *Overall accuracy 0.99



## Summary

I recommend use of the model as it was very accurate for healthy loans with 1.00 precision.
